# Remote Work Policy

**Effective Date:** March 1, 2025
**Last Updated:** March 1, 2025
**Policy Owner:** Human Resources Department

## 1. Purpose

This policy defines Acme Corporation's guidelines for remote work arrangements. The company supports flexible work options while maintaining productivity, collaboration, and security standards.

## 2. Eligibility

Remote work eligibility is determined by role requirements, employee performance, and manager approval. Employees must have completed their 90-day probationary period before requesting a remote work arrangement. Some roles designated as "on-site essential" are not eligible for remote work.

## 3. Remote Work Models

### 3.1 Hybrid Remote

Employees work from the office a minimum of 2 days per week (Tuesday and Thursday are designated in-office days) and may work remotely the remaining days. This is the default arrangement for eligible employees.

### 3.2 Fully Remote

Select roles may be approved for fully remote work. Fully remote employees must reside within the continental United States and be available during core business hours (10:00 AM - 3:00 PM ET). Fully remote employees are expected to visit the office at least once per quarter for team events.

### 3.3 Temporary Remote

Employees may request temporary fully remote work for up to 4 weeks per year for circumstances such as family obligations, home repairs, or personal preference. Requests must be submitted at least 1 week in advance.

## 4. Workspace Requirements

### 4.1 Home Office Setup

Remote employees must maintain a dedicated workspace that is:
- Quiet and free from regular distractions
- Equipped with reliable high-speed internet (minimum 25 Mbps download, 5 Mbps upload)
- Ergonomically appropriate (see Equipment Policy for reimbursement details)
- Secure and private for handling confidential information

### 4.2 Equipment

The company provides a laptop, monitor, keyboard, and mouse for all remote-eligible employees. A one-time home office stipend of $500 is available for new remote workers to set up their workspace. An annual stipend of $100 is provided for internet costs. See the Equipment Policy for full details.

## 5. Communication Expectations

### 5.1 Availability

Remote employees must be available on Slack and email during core hours (10:00 AM - 3:00 PM ET). Response time expectations: Slack messages within 30 minutes, emails within 4 hours during business hours. Employees must update their Slack status when stepping away for more than 15 minutes.

### 5.2 Meetings

All meetings should have a video conferencing option. Remote employees are expected to have cameras on during team meetings unless bandwidth is an issue. Managers should schedule recurring meetings during core hours to accommodate all time zones.

## 6. Performance and Accountability

Remote employees are held to the same performance standards as in-office employees. Managers will conduct monthly check-ins with remote team members to discuss workload, challenges, and collaboration. Remote work arrangements may be revoked if performance standards are not met after a 30-day improvement plan.

## 7. Security Requirements

Remote employees must:
- Use the company VPN when accessing internal systems
- Lock their computer when stepping away
- Not work from public WiFi networks without VPN
- Follow all guidelines in the Security Policy
- Report any security incidents immediately to security@acmecorp.com

## 8. Tax and Legal Considerations

Employees are responsible for understanding the tax implications of working from a different state than the office location. The company will comply with all applicable state labor laws where remote employees are based. Employees must notify HR within 30 days of any change in their work location.

## 9. Coworking Spaces

Employees who prefer not to work from home may request a coworking space membership. The company will reimburse up to $250/month for an approved coworking space. Receipts must be submitted through the expense portal monthly.

## 10. International Remote Work

Working from outside the United States requires prior written approval from HR and Legal. International remote work is limited to a maximum of 2 weeks per calendar year. Employees must ensure they have appropriate visa and work authorization for any international location.
