## 3. Floating Holidays

### 3.1 Allocation

Each employee receives 2 floating holidays per calendar year. Floating holidays are available starting January 1st. New hires who start after July 1st receive 1 floating holiday for the remainder of the year.

### 3.2 Usage

- Floating holidays may be used for any reason (religious observances, personal celebrations, etc.)
- Must be requested through the HR portal at least 3 business days in advance
- Subject to manager approval based on business needs
- Cannot be split into half-days
- Must be used within the calendar year; floating holidays do not carry over

## 4. Holiday Pay

### 4.1 Eligible Employees

All regular full-time employees receive their regular rate of pay for company holidays. Part-time employees who are regularly scheduled to work on a holiday receive holiday pay for their scheduled hours.

### 4.2 Holiday Premium Pay

Non-exempt employees required to work on a company holiday receive 1.5x their regular rate for hours worked, in addition to holiday pay (effectively 2.5x total). Exempt employees required to work on a holiday receive a compensatory day off to be used within 30 days.

### 4.3 Holidays on Weekends

When a holiday falls on a Saturday, the preceding Friday will be observed. When a holiday falls on a Sunday, the following Monday will be observed.

## 5. Holiday Office Closure

### 5.1 Office Hours

Company offices are closed on all fixed holidays. Essential personnel (IT operations, security) may be required to work on holidays with advance notice and holiday premium pay.

### 5.2 Year-End Shutdown

Acme Corporation observes a year-end office shutdown from December 24th through January 1st. Employees are given December 24, 25, 31, and January 1 as paid holidays. December 26 and December 29-30 require employees to use PTO or floating holidays (3 days total). Essential personnel exemptions apply.

## 6. Religious and Cultural Observances

Acme Corporation respects the diverse religious and cultural practices of our employees. Employees who observe holidays not on the company calendar may:
- Use floating holidays
- Use PTO days
- Request schedule adjustments with manager approval
- Work with HR to arrange shift swaps where applicable

Managers should make reasonable accommodations for religious observances when requested.

## 7. Holiday Events

### 7.1 Company Holiday Party

The annual company holiday party is typically held in the second week of December. Attendance is optional but encouraged. The event is alcohol-inclusive; please drink responsibly.

### 7.2 Team Celebrations

Teams may organize their own holiday celebrations within the following guidelines:
- Budget: up to $50 per person from the team's social budget
- Celebrations should be inclusive and not centered on a single religion
- Must be held during business hours or immediately after (ending by 7 PM)
- Manager must approve the event and budget in advance

## 8. Holiday Travel Considerations

Employees planning holiday travel should:
- Submit PTO requests early (holiday weeks fill up quickly)
- Communicate travel plans with their manager at least 2 weeks in advance
- Ensure coverage for critical responsibilities during their absence
- Update out-of-office messages on email and Slack
