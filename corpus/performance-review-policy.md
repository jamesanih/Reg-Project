# Performance Review Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Last Updated:** January 25, 2025
**Policy Owner:** Human Resources Department

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes a fair, consistent, and transparent performance review process at Acme Corporation. Performance reviews are critical for employee development, compensation decisions, and organizational growth.

## 2. Review Cycle

### 2.1 Annual Review

Full performance reviews are conducted annually in Q1 (January-March) for the prior calendar year. All employees who have completed their probationary period are included.

### 2.2 Mid-Year Check-In

A lighter mid-year review occurs in July. This is a development-focused conversation, not tied directly to compensation decisions.

### 2.3 Probationary Review

New hires receive a 90-day probationary review. See the Onboarding Policy for details.

## 3. Performance Rating Scale

| Rating | Label | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Exceptional | Consistently exceeds all expectations; a role model |
| 4 | Exceeds Expectations | Frequently exceeds expectations in key areas |
| 3 | Meets Expectations | Fully meets all expectations for the role |
| 2 | Needs Improvement | Meets some but not all expectations |
| 1 | Unsatisfactory | Does not meet expectations; immediate action required |

A "Meets Expectations" (3) rating represents strong, solid performance. Most employees should expect to receive a 3 or 4. A rating of 5 is reserved for truly exceptional contributions.

## 4. Review Process

### 4.1 Self-Assessment

Employees complete a self-assessment form covering:
- Key accomplishments against goals set for the review period
- Challenges encountered and how they were addressed
- Skills developed and areas for growth
- Goals for the upcoming period

Self-assessments are due by January 31st.

### 4.2 Peer Feedback

Each employee selects 2-3 peers and their manager selects 1-2 additional peers to provide 360-degree feedback. Peer feedback covers collaboration, communication, and technical skills. Feedback is shared with the manager but not directly attributed to specific peers.

### 4.3 Manager Assessment

Managers review self-assessments and peer feedback, then complete their assessment including:
- Performance against each goal (rated 1-5)
- Behavioral competency ratings
- Overall performance rating
- Development recommendations
- Compensation recommendation

### 4.4 Calibration

Department heads and HR conduct calibration sessions to ensure consistency across teams. Ratings may be adjusted during calibration to maintain fair standards. The distribution guideline (not a forced ranking) is:
- 5 (Exceptional): ~5% of employees
- 4 (Exceeds): ~25% of employees
- 3 (Meets): ~55% of employees
- 2 (Needs Improvement): ~10% of employees
- 1 (Unsatisfactory): ~5% of employees

### 4.5 Review Meeting

Managers schedule a 60-minute review meeting with each direct report to:
- Discuss performance ratings and feedback
- Review development opportunities
- Set goals for the next review period
- Discuss career aspirations and growth paths

All review meetings must be completed by March 15th.

## 5. Goal Setting

### 5.1 SMART Goals

All goals must be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Employees should have 3-5 goals per review period. At least one goal should be focused on professional development.

### 5.2 Goal Categories

- **Business Impact:** Goals aligned with team and company OKRs
- **Technical/Functional:** Role-specific skill improvement goals
- **Development:** Career growth and learning goals
- **Collaboration:** Cross-functional or teamwork goals

## 6. Compensation Decisions

### 6.1 Merit Increases

Annual merit increases are tied to performance ratings:
- 5 (Exceptional): 6-8% increase
- 4 (Exceeds): 4-6% increase
- 3 (Meets): 2-4% increase
- 2 (Needs Improvement): 0-1% increase
- 1 (Unsatisfactory): No increase

Merit increases are effective April 1st and reflected in the April 15th paycheck.

### 6.2 Promotions

Promotion eligibility requires:
- At least 12 months in current role
- Performance rating of 4 or 5 in the most recent review
- Demonstrated readiness for next-level responsibilities
- Manager and skip-level manager approval
- Headcount availability

### 6.3 Bonuses

Annual bonuses are discretionary and based on individual performance and company financial results. Bonus targets by level:
- Individual contributor: 5-10% of base salary
- Manager: 10-15% of base salary
- Director and above: 15-25% of base salary

## 7. Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs)

### 7.1 When PIPs Are Used

A PIP is initiated when an employee receives a rating of 1 or 2, or when significant performance concerns arise at any time during the year.

### 7.2 PIP Process

1. Manager, HR, and employee meet to discuss concerns
2. Written PIP document outlines specific expectations and timeline (typically 30-60 days)
3. Weekly check-ins during the PIP period
4. At the end of the PIP: confirm improvement, extend PIP, or proceed to termination

### 7.3 Employee Rights

Employees on a PIP may:
- Request clarification on expectations at any time
- Provide written responses to the PIP
- Request a meeting with HR independently
- Not be retaliated against for raising concerns about the PIP process

## 8. Documentation

All performance review documents are retained in the employee's personnel file for 5 years after separation. Employees can access their own review history through the HR portal.
