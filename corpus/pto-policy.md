# Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Last Updated:** January 15, 2025
**Policy Owner:** Human Resources Department

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes guidelines for Paid Time Off (PTO) at Acme Corporation. PTO encompasses vacation days, personal days, and sick leave under a single unified bank to give employees maximum flexibility.

## 2. Eligibility

All regular full-time employees are eligible for PTO benefits starting on their date of hire. Part-time employees working 20 or more hours per week receive prorated PTO benefits based on their scheduled hours. Temporary employees and independent contractors are not eligible for PTO.

## 3. PTO Accrual Rates

PTO accrues on a per-pay-period basis according to the following schedule:

### 3.1 Full-Time Employees

| Years of Service | Annual PTO Days | Accrual per Pay Period |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 0-2 years       | 15 days        | 4.62 hours           |
| 3-5 years       | 20 days        | 6.15 hours           |
| 6-10 years      | 25 days        | 7.69 hours           |
| 11+ years       | 30 days        | 9.23 hours           |

### 3.2 Part-Time Employees

Part-time employees accrue PTO on a prorated basis. For example, an employee working 20 hours per week will accrue at 50% of the full-time rate.

## 4. PTO Carryover

Employees may carry over a maximum of 5 unused PTO days into the next calendar year. Any unused PTO beyond 5 days will be forfeited on December 31st. Employees will receive email reminders in October and November about unused PTO balances.

## 5. Requesting PTO

### 5.1 Advance Notice

- **1-2 days PTO:** At least 1 week advance notice
- **3-5 days PTO:** At least 2 weeks advance notice
- **More than 5 days PTO:** At least 4 weeks advance notice

### 5.2 Request Process

All PTO requests must be submitted through the HR portal (hr.acmecorp.com). Managers must respond to PTO requests within 3 business days. If no response is given within 3 business days, the request is automatically approved.

### 5.3 Approval Considerations

Managers should approve PTO requests unless there is a critical business need. No more than 25% of a team may be on PTO simultaneously. PTO requests during blackout periods (company-wide deadlines, product launches) may be denied.

## 6. Unplanned Absences

Employees who need to take unplanned time off due to illness or emergency must notify their manager as soon as possible, preferably before their scheduled start time. Three or more consecutive sick days require a doctor's note upon return. Excessive unplanned absences (more than 8 occurrences in a rolling 12-month period) may result in a performance discussion.

## 7. PTO Payout at Separation

Upon voluntary resignation with at least 2 weeks notice, employees will receive payout for unused accrued PTO up to a maximum of 10 days. Employees terminated for cause forfeit unused PTO. In the event of layoffs, all accrued PTO will be paid out in the final paycheck.

## 8. Holidays vs. PTO

Company-designated holidays are separate from PTO and do not reduce PTO balances. If an employee is on PTO during a company holiday, that holiday does not count as a PTO day. See the Holiday Schedule policy for the complete list of company holidays.

## 9. PTO During Probationary Period

New employees in their 90-day probationary period accrue PTO but may only use up to 3 PTO days during this period. Exceptions may be granted by the employee's manager and HR for pre-planned commitments discussed during the hiring process.
